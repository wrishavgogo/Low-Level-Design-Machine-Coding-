Basic Things we need to keep in mind to write clean code :

1. Give meaningful names to variables, functions, classes, and other entities in the code.
2. Create functions that are small and do a single thing.
3. Encapsulate related data and functions into small independent classes.
4. Structure the code for better readability. Keep related code together and keep the lines smaller.
5. Enhance readability with proper comments.
6. Write readable, fast, independent, and repeatable tests.



Few Tips which we will deep dive later : 

1. Avoid code repetitions (DRY).
2. Keep the code simple (KISS).
3. Hide implementation details (Abstraction).
4. Keep the code extensible (Extensibility).
5. Keep the code modular with minimal overlap (Separation of Concerns). - Minimum Coupling 
6. Each module should do only one thing (Curly's law).
7. Avoid unnecessary functionalities (YAGNI) and preoptimization (the root of all evil). - Don't implement foreseeing features for the future . Only implement when it is required 
8. Stay consistent and avoid surprises in the code (Principle of least astonishment).  - Your code should not suprise maintainers , it should be doing exactly what it seems to be from first glance 
9. Make the code better than how you found it (Boy-Scout Rule).
