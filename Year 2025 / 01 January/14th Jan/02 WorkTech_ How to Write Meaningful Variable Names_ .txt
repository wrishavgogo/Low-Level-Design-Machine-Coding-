1. Use Intention-Revealing Names

2. Name Functions as Verbs

3. Name Classes as Nouns

4. Use Meaningful Distinction

Avoid Noise words : Noise words like Data, Value, Info, Variable, Table, String, Object, etc which are used as a suffix do not offer any meaningful distinction. Noise words are redundant and should be avoided.

Examples
String status;
String statusValue;

class Product {
}

class ProductInfo {
}

5. Use Pronounceable Names

Bad Examples -> Date modDateYYMMDD;
Good Examples -> Date modificationTimestamp;

6. Use Searchable Names

7. Avoid Encodings

Avoid using any unnecessary prefixes or suffixes. 

//String suffix ties the variable to the data type that makes it difficult to be changed later.
String locationString;

//The prefix I should be avoided for Interfaces
interface IEmployee {
}
