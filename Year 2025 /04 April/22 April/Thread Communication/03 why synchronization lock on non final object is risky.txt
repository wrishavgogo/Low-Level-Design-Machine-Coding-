is there a problem with Synchronization on a non-final field 'lock'  ? 


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî synchronizing on a non-final field like lock can be risky, though it‚Äôs not immediately wrong. Here's a clean explanation of the why and what to do about it:

üîç What's the issue with synchronizing on a non-final field?
java
Copy
Edit
private Object lock = new Object(); // ‚ùå mutable, not final
When you synchronize like this:

java
Copy
Edit
synchronized (lock) {
    // critical section
}
It works fine as long as lock always points to the same object. But if any code accidentally or intentionally changes the lock reference, then:

Other threads might still be synchronizing on the old object.

New code might be synchronizing on the new object.

This breaks the guarantee of mutual exclusion ‚Äî which can lead to race conditions, missed signals, or deadlocks.
