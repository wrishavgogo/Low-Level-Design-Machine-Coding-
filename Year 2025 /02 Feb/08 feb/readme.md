Today I was watching a few low level design videos . And came across the Low level design of IRCTC . 

There i saw an interesting way of designing paymentGatewayApi . 


So as users we are given this option of 

1. CreditCard
2. DebitCard
3. GooglePay
4. Netbanking

When we click on any of these options , we are furthur given an opputunity to do choose which bank we want to facilitate these services from .

Example HDFC , SBI (for netbanking ) 
AXIS , ONE , ACE ( for credit card )
