public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return Holder.INSTANCE;
    }
lets say two threads reach here , and both call Holder.Instance , 
note this is the first time its getting called , so will it be getting initialized once or multiple times ?

Great question — you're testing the heart of the Bill Pugh Singleton pattern.

🤖 Situation:
Two threads call this simultaneously for the first time:

java
Copy
Edit
public static Singleton getInstance() {
    return Holder.INSTANCE;
}
💡 Answer:
✅ The Holder.INSTANCE will be initialized only once, even if multiple threads access it at the same time for the first time.

🛡️ Why?
Because of Java's class loading guarantees:

Class initialization is synchronized by the JVM.

The static field INSTANCE is initialized exactly once, and no thread sees a partially constructed object.

Even if 100 threads call getInstance() at the same time, the class loader ensures that Holder is loaded once and INSTANCE is created once.

🔬 JVM Guarantees from the JLS (Java Language Specification):
"At most one thread will execute a class's static initializer. Other threads will block until the class initialization completes."

📦 So:
Scenario	What Happens
2 threads call getInstance()	Holder is loaded once
Multiple threads, first-time access	Blocked until initialization finishes
Already initialized	Just returns the existing instance (fast)

✅ Safe, Lazy, and Efficient Singleton
The Bill Pugh pattern gives you:

Lazy loading ✔

Thread safety ✔

No synchronization overhead ✔

No double-checked locking ❌🚫

Let me know if you want to simulate this behavior with a small multi-threaded example!







You said:
Holder is loaded once , which thread will instantiate it. ?

Great follow-up.

💡 Which thread loads the Holder class and instantiates INSTANCE?
✅ The first thread that accesses Holder.INSTANCE will trigger the class loading and do the instantiation.

🔍 Detailed Explanation:
When multiple threads try to access this for the first time:

java
Copy
Edit
public static Singleton getInstance() {
    return Holder.INSTANCE;
}
If Thread A reaches this line first, the JVM will:

Load the Holder class

Run its static initializers (initialize INSTANCE)

Return the INSTANCE to Thread A

Other threads (e.g., Thread B, C, etc.) that reach this line at the same time will:

Block at the class initialization step

Wait until the Holder class is fully initialized by Thread A

Then simply read the INSTANCE

⚠️ JVM Guarantee:
Class initialization is atomic and synchronized internally by the JVM — only one thread initializes a class, others wait.
