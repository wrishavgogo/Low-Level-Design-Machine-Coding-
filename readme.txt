We will have questions and notes from books and topics we need to study as well 

The naming of the folders will be in the format of Year - Month - Date . 
That way we will ensure order is maintained .

First Priority should be least year . 
If within same Year , then Month Should be taken into account . 

If Same Month then date comes into play
